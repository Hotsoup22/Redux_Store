# Redux-Store

## Description

Refactored an application that uses the Context API so that it handles state using the open source JavaScript library Redux.

- What was your motivation? simplify state management in more complex applications. 
- Why did you build this project? Redux is predictable, centralized, debuggable, flexible, works great with react.

## User Story

```md
AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform
I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API
SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem
```
## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state
WHEN I review the appâ€™s store
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API
WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider
WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state
THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API
WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
```
